<h1 style="color:#6600cc;font-family:courier;font-size:200%;">HOW IS AI USED?</h1>
<pre style="color:#ffffff;font-family:courier;">Artificial intelligence generally falls under two broad categories: 


Narrow AI: Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI," this kind of
 artificial intelligence operates within a limited context and is a 
 simulation of human intelligence.Narrow AI is often focused
 on performing a single task extremely well and while these machines
 may seem intelligent, they are operating under far more constraints and
 limitations than even the most basic human intelligence. 
 
 
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): AGI, sometimes referred to as
 "Strong AI," is the kind of artificial intelligence we see in the movies, 
 like the robots from Westworld or Data from Star Trek: The Next 
 Generation. AGI is a machine with general intelligence and, much like
 a human being, it can apply that intelligence to solve any problem.
