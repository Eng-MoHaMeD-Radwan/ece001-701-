<h2 style="color:#ffffff;">What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
<p style="color:#ff66ff;">Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science
 concerned with building<br> smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.<br>
 AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine <br> learning and deep learning are 
 creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.</br> </p>
<h3 style="color:#ffffff;">HOW DOES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WORK?</h3>
<h3 style="color:#00ccff">Can machines think? â€” Alan Turing, 1950</h3>
<p style="color:#ffffff;font-family:'times new remon'">Less than a decade after breaking the Nazi encryption machine<br> Enigma and helping the Allied Forces win World War II, <br>mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with <br>a simple question: "Can machines think?" <br>
Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), and <br>it's subsequent Turing Test, established the fundamental goal and<br> vision of artificial intelligence.   
At it's core, AI is the branch of computer science that <br>aims to answer Turing's question in the affirmative. It is the endeavor to replicate or<br> simulate human intelligence in machines.
The expansive goal of artificial intelligence<br> has given rise to many questions and debates. So much so, that no singular definition <br>of the field is universally accepted.  <br>
The major limitation in defining AI as simply "building machines <br>that are intelligent" is that it doesn't actually explain what artificial <br>intelligence is? What makes a machine intelligent?
In their groundbreaking textbook<br> Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, authors Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig approach<br>the question by unifying their work around the theme of intelligent agents in machines. <br>With this in mind, AI is "the study of agents that receive percepts <br>from the environment and perform actions." (Russel and Norvig viii)
Norvig and Russell<br> go on to explore four different approaches that have historically defined the field of AI:</br> </p>
  <ol style="color:#ffffff;">
  <li>Thinking humanly</li>
  <li>Thinking rationally</li>
  <li>Acting humanly</li>
  <li>Acting rationally</li>
  <p>The first two ideas concern thought processes and reasoning, while <br> the others deal with behavior. Norvig and Russell focus particularly <br> on rational agents that act to achieve the best outcome, <br> noting "all the skills needed for the Turing Test also allow an agent to act rationally." (Russel and Norvig 4). <br><br>
Patrick Winston, the Ford professor of artificial intelligence and <br> computer science at MIT, defines AI as  "algorithms enabled by <br> constraints, exposed by representations that support models targeted <br> at loops that tie thinking, perception and action together." </br></p>
</ol>
<p style="color:#ffffff;">-While these definitions may seem abstract to the average person, they help focus the field as<br>
 an area of computer science and provide a blueprint for infusing machines and programs with<br>
 machine learning and other subsets of artificial intelligence. <br><br>

While addressing a crowd at the Japan AI Experience in 2017,  DataRobot CEO Jeremy<br>
 Achin began his speech by offering the following definition of how AI is used today:<br><br>

"AI is a computer system able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence...<br>
 Many of these artificial intelligence systems are powered by machine learning, some of them<br>
 are powered by deep learning and some of them are powered by very boring things like rules." </p>
